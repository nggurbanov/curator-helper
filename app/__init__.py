# app/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'app' directory a Python package.
# You can perform package-level initializations here if needed.

# Example: Define a logger for the whole app package
import logging
# logging.getLogger(__name__).addHandler(logging.NullHandler()) # To avoid "No handler found" warnings if not configured by main

# You could also make some key components easily importable from 'app'
# from .config import BOT_TOKEN # Example
